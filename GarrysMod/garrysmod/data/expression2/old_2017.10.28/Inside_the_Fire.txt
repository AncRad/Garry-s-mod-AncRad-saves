########        Desturbed   Inside the Fire        ########

                Devon
                Won't go to heaven
                She's just another lost soul
                About to be mine again
                Leave her
                We will receive her
                It is beyond your control
                Will you ever meet again
                
                Devon
                No longer living
                Who had been rendered unwhole
                As a little child
                She was taken
                And then forsaken
                You will remember it all
                Let it blow your mind again
                
                Devon lies beyond this portal
                Take the word of one immortal
                
                Give your soul to me
                For eternity
                Release your life
                To begin another time with her
                End your grief with me
                There's another way
                Release your life
                Take your place inside the fire with love
                
                Sever
                Now and forever
                You're just another lost soul
                About to be mine again
                See her, you'll never free her
                You must surrender it all
                Would you like to meet again
                
                Fire
                All you desire
                As she begins to turn cold and run out of time
                You will shiver
                Till you deliver
                You will remember it all
                Let it blow your mind again
                
                Devon lies beyond this portal
                Take the word of one immortal
                
                Give your soul to me
                For eternity
                Release your life
                To begin another time with her
                End your grief with me
                There's another way
                Release your life
                Take your place inside the fire with love
                
                Here I am!
